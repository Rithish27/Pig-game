This  is a game named "pi-game" built using HTML,CSS and JS.

Here are the Rules:

  Starting the Game:
    Two players take turns to play.
    Decide who goes first.
    
  Player Turn:
    On a player's turn, they roll the die.
    The number rolled is added to their current turn total.
    If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points gained during that turn.
    
  Hold or Continue:
    After each roll, a player can choose to either:
    Hold: Add the turn total to their overall score and end their turn.
    Continue: Roll the die again to accumulate more points.
    
  Scoring:
    The sum of the numbers rolled on the die during a turn is added to the player's turn total.
    If a player rolls a 1, their turn total is reset to zero, and they lose their chance to score further in that turn.
    
  Winning:
    The first player to reach a pre-determined total score (commonly 100 points) wins the game.
    Players must reach or exceed the target score exactly; if a roll would cause them to exceed the target, they don't score any points in that turn.
